Trivia Game

The trvia game is a multiple choice game focusing on Marvel universe questions. The player will have a limited time length to finish the game. When the time runs out (regardless of whether or not they finished), the game will end and they will be shown the number of answers they got correct and incorrect.

There is a timer so that players know how much time they have left and the game also prevents players from picking more than one answer for each question.
